    "Built-in functions are pre-defined functions provided by the Python programming language itself. They are part of Python's standard library and can be directly used without the need for any additional imports or definitions. These functions cover a wide range of operations and tasks, such as working with strings, lists, mathematical calculations, file operations, etc.\n",
