    "Advantageous:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Code Reusability: Functions allow to define a block of code once and reuse it multiple times throughout program. Instead of writing the same code in multiple places,we can call the function wherever we need that functionality, reducing redundancy and making code more concise and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Modularity: Functions break down a program into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function represents a specific task or operation, making the code easier to understand, organize, and maintain. It also promotes team collaboration as different developers can work on different functions independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Abstraction: Functions provide a level of abstraction, hiding the implementation details from the rest of the program. By calling a function with its name and passing appropriate arguments, we can use its functionality without needing to know how it is implemented internally. This simplifies the overall codebase and makes it easier to work with complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Readability: Well-designed functions with meaningful names can make code more readable and self-explanatory. A descriptive function name conveys its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Debugging and Testing: Functions enable easier debugging and testing. Since each function performs a specific task, it becomes simpler to isolate and identify bugs or issues within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Encapsulation: Functions enable us to encapsulate functionality and data within their scope. This means that variables and operations inside a function are generally separate from the rest of the program. It helps in preventing unintended variable modifications and promotes better code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, functions are a powerful programming construct that significantly improves the structure, readability, and maintainability of acode. They promote code reuse, modularity, and abstraction, leading to more efficient development and easier collaboration among team members.\n",
