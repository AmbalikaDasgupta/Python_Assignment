    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Conciseness: Lambda functions allow us to define simple functions with minimal syntax. This can make our code more compact and easier to read when the logic is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Anonymous: Lambda functions are anonymous, which means we don't need to come up with a descriptive function name if the function is only used in a single place.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Readability: For simple operations, using a lambda function directly inline with higher-order functions (like map, filter, sorted, etc.) can improve the readability of our code, as the logic is presented more closely to its usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Short-Lived Functions: Lambda functions are useful when we need a function for a brief period or for a specific context, avoiding the need to define a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Limited Complexity: Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression, which means they can't contain multiple statements or more complex logic. This limitation can make them unsuitable for functions with more intricate behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Limited Reusability: Due to their anonymous nature, lambda functions can't be reused in multiple places within code. Regular functions can be defined with descriptive names and used wherever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Readability Concerns: Complex lambda expressions might reduce code readability, as cramming too much logic into a single line can make the code harder to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Debugging Challenges: Debugging lambda functions can be more difficult since they lack explicit names to identify them in error messages or stack traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Lack of Documentation: Lambda functions don't support docstrings, making it harder to provide clear documentation for their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Scoping Issues: While lambda functions can access variables from their containing scope, there might be cases where scoping becomes tricky and leads to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "g) Less Intuitive for Beginners: Lambda functions might be less intuitive for those new to programming or Python, as they might not immediately understand their purpose and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lambda functions are great for simple, one-off operations and for making code more concise in specific contexts. "
